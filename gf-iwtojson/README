This is a local modified version of the iw command.
It has been modified to make screen scraping of the Vendor Information Elements easier.

The original README follows:


>This is 'iw', a tool to use nl80211.
>
>
>To build iw, just enter 'make'. If that fails, set the
>PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to allow the Makefile
>to find libnl.
>
>
>'iw' is currently maintained at http://git.sipsolutions.net/iw.git/,
>some more documentation is available at
>http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/iw.
>
>Please send all patches to Johannes Berg <johannes@sipsolutions.net>
>and CC linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org for community review.
